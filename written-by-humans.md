# What's the "Written by Humans" badge?

In the age of LLMs and other AI, authentic human content is becoming more and more valuable. Even if you support AI, there still needs to be a way to accurately label human data, to avoid [model collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493).

Even if you don't use or support AI, this badge is just a nice flex saying that you don't need an AI to help you create content.

## Qualifications

 - 70% of content (code, prose, media, etc) must have directly originated from a human
 - Algorithmic modifications (non-stochastic AI) do not count as "non-human origin"

TODO: More information (and move this to blog post)
