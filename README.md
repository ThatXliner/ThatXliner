# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
Iâ€™m Bryan, a programmer who loves logic puzzles. I mainly know Python, C++ for USACO, make web apps in JavaScript/NodeJS or Svelte, and Iâ€™m learning Rust.

## Programming arsenal

*The task is the monster, my tools are my weapons.*

Python is my main weapon of choice. I know a lot of Python. It was actually my first language! Iâ€™m fluent in it and I know how to use a lot of libraries for Python.

JavaScript is for my casual scripting needs on the web. I use it whether I need to quickly scrape data from a site or need to use a JS library. Everyone should know JavaScript, not because itâ€™s a good language but because the web is powered by it (and HTMLâ€¦ and CSSâ€¦).

While Iâ€™ve only recently started learning Rust, I plan to use Rust (and C++ which I know, to some extent, as well) for speeding up my programs. Or if my future job requires it. Rust > C++
