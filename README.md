# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
Iâ€™m Bryan, a programmer who loves logic puzzles. I mainly know Python, dabble in JavaScript (but can whip up some scripts if I want to), and Iâ€™m learning Rust.

## Programming arsenal
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Kite](https://www.kite.com) + [TabNine](https://www.tabnine.com)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [JavaScript](http://www.ecmascript.org)
- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)

*The task is the monster, my tools are my weapons.*

Python is my main weapon of choice. I know a lot of Python. It was actually my first language! Iâ€™m fluent in it and I know how to use a lot of libraries for Python.

JavaScript is for my casual scripting needs on the web. I use it whether I need to quickly scrape data from a site or need to use a JS library. Everyone should know JavaScript, not because itâ€™s a good language but because the web is powered by it (and HTMLâ€¦ and CSSâ€¦).

While Iâ€™ve only recently started learning Rust, I plan to use Rust (and C++ which I know, to some extent, as well) for speeding up my programs. Or if my future job requires it. Rust > C++
